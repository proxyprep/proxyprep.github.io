                                trees and dynamic programming. <br> <br> The interview also involved discussion of my academic projects and the internship mentioned on my CV. The feedback session gave me a deep insight

                                From being someone with zero experience in interviews, proxy mock interviews got me interview ready with detailed feedbacks and proper resume suggestions. Also the coding questions asked were really helpful. The way core concepts and projects were discussed

                                which help me in framing new solutions with the changes .And in the end the feedback session gave me an insight on where i lacked ( like cs fundamentals and some key points of my project ). <br>                                <br> I will highly recommend proxy interview to everyone preparing for interview and placement .
